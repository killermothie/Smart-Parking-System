# Smart Parking Management & Navigation System

## Project Overview
This project addresses urban parking challenges in CBDs by providing real-time parking occupancy monitoring, AI-based predictive analytics, driver guidance via LED signage, and automated payment integration.

## Key Features
- Real-time vehicle detection using load cells and ultrasonic sensors
- Embedded system control with Arduino Mega
- Predictive analytics with AI/ML for peak parking prediction
- LED signage displaying available slots and navigation guidance
- Digital payment system integration for seamless transactions
- Data logging for performance monitoring and optimization

## System Components
- Arduino Mega microcontroller
- Load cells and ultrasonic sensors
- LED signage panels
- Payment interface module
- Python for AI/ML analytics

## Functionality
1. Sensors detect vehicle presence in parking slots.
2. Arduino Mega processes sensor data and updates availability.
3. LED signage guides drivers to empty slots.
4. AI module predicts peak occupancy times and optimizes slot allocation.
5. Payment system allows automatic slot booking and payment.
